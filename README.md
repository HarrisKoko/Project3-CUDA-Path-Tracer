### Description

This project is a physically based Monte Carlo path tracer implemented in CUDA. It simulates global illumination by tracing rays through a scene, recursively scattering and absorbing light to approximate the rendering equation. The focus of this renderer is on leveraging GPU parallelism to achieve realistic images at interactive to near-interactive speeds. This enables efficient and physically realistic rendering of scenes. 

This path tracer supports:
*Light Transport according Diffuse, reflective, and refractive materials.
*Intersection handling for spheres, boxes, and triangles.
*GTLF Mesh loading for creation of complex scenes.
*BVH acceleration structure for efficient rayâ€“scene intersection.
*Cosine weighted hemisphere sampling.
*Stochastic sampled antialiasing.
*Stream compaction to remove terminated rays and improve warp coherence.
*Sorting of material types in memory to reduce GPU memory lookups.
